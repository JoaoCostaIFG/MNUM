# MNUM
Code and practice exercises I did for the MNUM chair (FEUP MIEIC MNUM 2nd year
1st semester).  

# Practical Classes
It's possible that some of the code I did for practical classes has some
mistakes/is not optimal.  
At the beginning of each file that I fully check for mistakes/errors,
I'll leave a comment saying so (in case there's no comment, I haven't checked
it so proceed with caution).  

# Tests/Exams
In contrast to my methodology for practical classes, for the tests/exam I tried to
solve the exercises as directly and quickly as possible so expect code that's
sloppy and easy, and quick to write/copy. Theoric questions are answered with has
much detail as I could find.  
I believe that this part of the repository is the most important for the
course.  
This part also contains the exercises solved so you can try solving them
yourself.  
**All exam resolutions have been checked and are trust-worthy (theoric questions
can always be better so feel free to complement them).**  

# Notes/Tips
All the python code in this repository was written by me.  
Remember to always submit some for all the question during the test. Even if
the teacher doesn't explicitly ask for any code (sometimes he'll grade questions
without code with 0).  
I'm sorry for not having much stuff relating to the 1st test. I used to solve them
using python's REPL so I don't have the code. The most important topics about the
first test should show up on the exams' resolutions.  
You should focus on the theory for the first test.  
You should focus on the code implementation of the methods for the second test.
