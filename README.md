# MNUM
Code and practice exercises I did for the MNUM chair (FEUP MIEIC MNUM 2nd year
1st semester).  

# Practical Classes
It's possible that some of the code I did for practical classes has some
mistakes/is not optimal.  
At the beginning of each file that I fully check for mistakes/errors,
I'll leave a comment saying so (in case there's no comment, I haven't checked
it so proceed with caution).  
Much of the code here is overly complicated considering the objectives of
the Class/Tests/Exams so they are prone to have mistakes.
I'll try to correct most of them.

# Tests/Exams
In contrast to my methodology for practical classes, for the tests/exam I tried to
solve the exercises as directly and quickly as possible so expect code that's
sloppy and easy, and quick to write/copy.  
I believe that this part of the repository is the most important for the class.
This part also contains the exercises solved so you can try them yourself.

# Notes
All the python code in this repository was written by me.  
Remember to always submit some code, during the test, for all the question, even
if the teacher doesn't ask for any (sometimes he'll grade with 0 in those questions
if you don't do so).  
I'm sorry for not having much stuff relating to the 1st test. I used to solve them
using python's REPL.
