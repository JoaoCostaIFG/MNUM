# MNUM
Code and practice exercises I did for the MNUM chair (FEUP MIEIC MNUM 2nd year
1st semester).  

# Practical Classes
It's possible that some of the code I did for practical classes has some
mistakes/is not optimal.  
At the beginning of each file that I fully check for mistakes/errors,
I'll leave a comment saying so (in case there's no comment, I haven't checked
it so proceed with caution).  
Much of the code here is overly complicated considering the objectives of
the Class/Tests/Exams so they are prone to have mistakes.
I'll try to correct most of them.

# Tests/Exams
In contrast to my methodology for practical classes, for the tests/exam I tried to
solve the exercises as directly and quickly as possible so expect code that's
sloppy and easy, and quick to write/copy.  
I believe that this part of the repository is the most important for the class.
This part also contains the exercises solved so you can try them yourself.

# Notes
Remember to always submit some code, during the test, for all the question, even
if the teacher doesn't ask for any (sometimes he'll grade with 0 in those questions
if you don't do so).  
I'm sorry for not having much stuff relating to the 1st test. I used to solve them
using python's REPL.
