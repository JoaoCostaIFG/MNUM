1)
Step integration step that was used is 0.2. We see this by finding a dot in the graph that lines with a value on the x axis, e.g.: 1. It takes 5 steps to go from 0 to 1 on the x axis of the graph: (1 - 0) / 5 = 0.2

2)
x(0) = 1
This can easily be observed on the graph.

3)
Not sure about what to do here (besides trial and error with the different given possible values for k).

dx/dt = y

m * dy/dt + c * y + k * x = 0
<=> dy/dt = (-k*x -c*y) / m

With the given conditions, we get:
dy/dt = -(k*x + y) / 20

(check code for this question now)
Answer: k = 5
