Solved in maxima

eq:%e ^ x - x - 5;
plot2d(eq, [x, -10, 0]);

By ploting the equation we can see it has a root in the interval (-6, -4)

plot2d(eq, [x, 0, 5]);
If we plot in a different range, we can see the graph as another root in the inter (1, 2)


2)
Solved in maxima

eq1: %e ^ x - 5;
eq2: log(5 + x);

Formula 1:
plot2d(diff(eq1, x), [x, -6, -4], [y, -1, 1]);
plot2d(diff(eq1, x), [x, 1, 2], [y, -1, 1]);

The graph is only drawn for the (-6, -4) interval, so the 1st formula only converges for the negative root.

Formula 2:
plot2d(diff(eq2), [x, -6, -4], [y, -1, 1]);
plot2d(diff(eq2), [x, 1, 2], [y, -1, 1]);

The graph is only drawn for the (1, 2) interval, so the 2nd formula only converges for the positive root.


3)
(Check the code for both of the methods)
The other method we'll consider is the Newton's method.
We'll use the same inicial guess (1) and max error (0.01) for both and see which converges faster to the positive root.
We can see that the Newton's method stabilzies first (less iterations).
